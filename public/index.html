    <h3>Golf 🏌️</h3>

      <p>
        I started playing golf during my time in college but never took the
        sport seriously until I had graduated and was looking for a job. In that
        time I started to play and gradually grew more and more in love with the
        sport. The best part of playing golf is the people you play with. No
        matter what happens while playing, just knowing you have good people
        around you just makes everything better.
